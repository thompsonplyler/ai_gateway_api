Tasks accomplished thus far: 

Okay, here's a brief summary of the features we've implemented and verified with passing tests:
User Model: Created User model with email, password_digest, validations, and has_secure_password.
API Token Model: Created ApiToken model linked to User, with auto-generated token and expires_at.
AI Task Model: Created AiTask model linked to User, storing prompt, status (enum with default), result, error_message.
User Registration: Implemented POST /api/v1/users endpoint to create new users.
Login/Token Creation: Implemented POST /api/v1/session endpoint to authenticate users and return an ApiToken.
Base Authentication: Implemented token checking (Authorization: Bearer <token>) in ApplicationController to set @current_user.
AI Task Endpoints:
Implemented POST /api/v1/ai_tasks (authenticated) to create a task associated with the current user and enqueue a background job.
Implemented GET /api/v1/ai_tasks (authenticated) to list the current user's tasks.
Implemented GET /api/v1/ai_tasks/:id (authenticated) to show a specific task belonging to the current user.
Background Job: Implemented ProcessAiTaskJob to update task status, call the (mocked) OpenAI API, and store the result or error.
Testing: Established passing RSpec tests for models, request endpoints (including authentication and validation cases), and the background job (mocking external calls).

Full Project Outline (Remaining Steps):
Core API Functionality Completion:
Implement Logout: Add logic to DELETE /api/v1/session to destroy the user's ApiToken.
Refactor Specs with FactoryBot: Improve test setup maintainability.
Frontend Integration & Polish:
CORS Configuration: Allow requests from your frontend application's domain.
API Documentation: Generate interactive documentation (e.g., using Swagger/Rswag).
File Handling Feature:
Setup Active Storage: Configure Rails Active Storage for handling file uploads.
Modify API for Uploads: Update AiTasksController (or create new endpoints) to accept file parameters.
Update Job for File Processing: Modify ProcessAiTaskJob (or create new jobs) to handle file inputs, potentially identifying file types and calling appropriate multimodal AI models.
Handle File Responses: Determine how to return file-based results (e.g., download links via Active Storage URLs).
Agentic Logic Feature:
Design Workflows: Define the steps and decision points for multi-step AI interactions.
Implement Orchestration: Build the logic (likely in jobs or dedicated service objects) to manage the flow between AI calls based on intermediate results.
Update Models/State: Adapt AiTask or introduce new models to track the state of these complex workflows.
Production Hardening & Extensibility:
Rate Limiting/Usage Tracking: Implement controls to prevent abuse and monitor usage.
Enhanced Error Handling: Create more specific error responses and potentially use an error tracking service.
Support for Other AI Providers: Refactor configuration and jobs to allow easy integration of different AI services (Gemini, Claude, etc.).
User Roles/Permissions: (Optional) Add role-based access control if needed.
Next Three Steps:
Based on the current state and typical development flow, here are the most logical next three steps:
Implement Logout (SessionsController#destroy): This completes the fundamental authentication cycle (Register -> Login -> Use API -> Logout) and ensures tokens can be properly invalidated.
Refactor Specs with FactoryBot: Implementing factories now will make writing tests for all subsequent features (file handling, agentic logic, etc.) significantly cleaner and faster. It's a foundational improvement for maintainability.
Configure CORS: Since you mentioned intending to use this with a separate React frontend, enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is essential before you can make requests from that frontend running in a browser to this API.
